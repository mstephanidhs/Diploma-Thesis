# Diploma Thesis

Î¤he SeedLink protocol constitutes a universal communication protocol between seismological stations
and real-time seismic data storage/processing systems. It is utilized by all seismological
institutes/laboratories worldwide for collecting seismic data from various seismological stations and
networks. However, the transfer of these data occurs without encryption, exposing the system to
potential risks such as "man-in-the-middle" cyberattacks, subsequently leading to
misinformation by the relevant authorities, such as the General Secretariat for Civil Protection of the
respective state. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is the implementation of an appropriate
cryptographic mechanism in the SeedLink communication protocol to ensure the security of seismic
data transmission. This will effectively prevent the possibility of monitoring, interfering, or tampering
with the data, safeguarding their integrity and confidentiality.
